# Climate Data Model Specification

## Scope

This document defines the capabilities or functionalities of a data model to exchange climate data for use in performance simulation for building design, analysis, and operation. It makes recommendations towards, and provides examples of, vocabulary, naming conventions, unit system, and data relationships. The data model described in this document is applicable irrespective of the source of data for which it is used, including: 
•	measured or observed data, including both professional and amateur weather stations,
•	modeled or simulated data, including that from reanalysis models and projected climate models (Global Circulation Models).

The term “data model” as used here encompasses the climate data model for building performance simulation and design. This is a special case of the general data model for building data exchange published in the BSR/ASHRAE Standard 232P.

The scope of this consensus document does not cover post-processing and generation methods, quality control methods for the data, or changes to existing file formats.  


### Applicability

This data model is defined to accommodate data for building performance modeling or simulation, the design and operation of buildings, and calculations for compliance with building codes or beyond-code certifications.
 
Building performance simulation includes the modeling of energy, daylight and lighting, water, thermal properties, airflow, thermal and visual comfort, urban-scale effects, air quality parameters, and computational fluid dynamics. Calculations for compliance and certification includes climate risk assessment, resilience studies, and building certification schemes.


### Exclusions

This version of the data model does not cover data on soil conditions, ground water, and underground water resources, among others. It does not cover data for structural and geothermal calculations. These could be included as ‘custom fields’ initially by individual data vendors and users with the possibility to be included as ‘standard’ fields in future versions of the data model(s).

## Data Model

{{ add_data_model('ClimateInformation', base_level=3) }}

## Verification Rules

TimeSeries within a DataSet shall all have TimeIntervals with the same starting and ending timestamps.

## Publishing Rules

This data model does not consider the quality of the source data. That is, whether the data included in a given dataset are “correct”
or “true” for a given location and time. It merely defines the structures for exchanging data and the judgment about the quality or
appropriateness of data is left to the data publishers and users. Data providers using this model are encouraged to provide sources
where possible.

## Application Rules

None.
