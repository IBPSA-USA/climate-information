{{% blocks/cover title="About Climate Information Data Model" height="auto" %}}

This document provides the data model specifications for climate data and was developed through a stakeholder consensus process by the IBPSA-USA Building Data Exchange Committee. It is based on the standard framework and vocabulary provided in the BSR/ASHRAE Standard 205P-Full Public Review #3.

Some notes about this version and its expected evolution:

- The committee chose not to define an authoritative minimum viable data model, thus allowing users of the data model (data providers and consumers) to select the relevant variables and time periods according to their applications.
- The data elements are intended to reflect the common use cases of building thermal and daylight modeling. Other use cases may require a different set of data elements for their purposes.
- Currently the data model only covers metadata fields, location, and time series variables with regular and irregular time intervals. Future versions are expected to include structures for statistically-derived design conditions.
- This document does not separately consider how the data model should be serialized or the file formats that should be used for publication.
